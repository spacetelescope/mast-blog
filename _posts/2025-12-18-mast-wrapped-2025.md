Welcome to "MAST Wrapped 2025"! This post will present some highlights and statistics from this year at MAST. 

# Chapter 1: Data

## Total Number of Files in MAST

This year, MAST surpassed 1 BILLION FILES! This covers over 356,276,560 unique observations from 96 different telescopes - both in space (like HST and JWST) and on the Earth.

## New Data Added

MAST is growing VERY quickly: of those 1 billion files, 266 million of them were added in 2025! That's over 1.9 Petabytes of data. This number will only keep increasing: the Roman Space Telescope will add so much more when it launches next year!

## Data from Space

That's a lot of new data! We can also break it down by individual mission. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are among the most popular telescopes, and each delivered millions of new files this year:

## Legacy Missions
HST and JWST are only 2 of the 23+ missions that MAST contains data from. One legacy mission of note is Kepler! Kepler hasn't observed any new data since 2018, but it's still very popular: over 28.2 million Kepler files were downloaded this year!

## Busiest Day of the Year

The busiest day of the year for MAST was February 26. Over 9.11 million files were downloaded on that day. Why Febuary 26? We have no idea.

And if you're wondering "what kind of person would ever visit MAST from a gaming console?" The answer is me. I just wanted to see if I could!
