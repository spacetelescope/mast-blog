The release of Jdaviz happened this week! Woohoo!

If you do not know what Jdaviz is, here is a short description. [Jdaviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is 
an open source Python package developed to visualize and analyse data from 
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Its user interface can be used in Jupyter Notebooks, 
as a stand-alone application, or embedded in webpages (like our dear MAST does!) and it is designed to provide 
visualization and analysis machinery for both spectra and imaging.

This week, the team released [version 4.0](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/releases/tag/v4.0.0) which carries major updates. 
[Cubeviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cubeviz/index.html) (which is the Jdaviz configuration for cube data) 
is now equipped with a fully featured spectral extraction plugin, including 
exact extraction of fractional pixels, the possibility to do background subtraction, and unit conversion, especially useful for cubes 
in surface brightness (like those from JWST).

The other big update concerns the introduction of [Solara](https://solara.dev/) to replace [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
for the rendering of the stand-alone application. I will not go into the details and technicalities of this swap here, 
but I will note that this results in better performance and cleaner code on the Jdaviz side. 

The release of 4.0 carries also bug fixes and performance improvements all over the app and especially updates to the 
Export Plugin, which now allows for the export of calculated quantities in the other plugins (e.g., the results of Aperture Photometry) 
in table format, defined regions of interests or subsets as well in table format, and generated products (e.g., analytic models 
fitted to observed spectra or moment maps fitted to cube data) in FITS format.

To give it a try, [installation instruction can be found in the documentation online](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) 
and as always the team can be contacted via [github issues](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/issues) or 
[help desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/jwst) calls. Whenther you have JWST data or other data, enjoy!
