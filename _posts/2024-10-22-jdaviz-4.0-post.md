The release of Jdaviz happened this week! Woohoo!

If you do not know what Jdaviz is, here is a short description. [Jdaviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is 
an open source Python package developed to visualize and analyse data from 
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Its user interface can be used in Jupyter Notebooks, 
as a stand-alone application, or embedded in webpages (like our dear MAST does!) and it is designed to provide 
visualization and analysis machinery for both spectra and imaging.

This week, the team released [version 4.0](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/releases/tag/v4.0.0) which carries major updates. 
[Cubeviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cubeviz/index.html) (which is the Jdaviz configuration for cube data) 
is now equipped with a fully featured spectral extraction plugin, including 
exact extraction of fractional pixels, the possibility to do background subtraction, and unit conversion, especially useful for cubes 
in surface brightness (like those from JWST).

  the extracted spectra in the center (brighter spectrum) and in the outskirt clump (dimmer spectrum)." width="200"/>

The image shows the cube of NGC7469, a galaxy with an active galactic nucleus in the center, 
observed as part of [program 1328](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/dd-ers/program-1328). The top 
left viewer shows the flux cube at 2.13 micron and the three spetial subsets used for the analysis. The top right viewer shows 
the calculated velocity map of the H-alpha line obtained with the Moment Map plugin. The bottom viewer shows the spectra extracted 
in the center (red spectrum) and in the outskirt clump (blue spectrum) using the newly updated Spectral Extraction plugin. 
To the right, the plugin tray is open, showing all the visualization and analysis plugins available in the tool.

The other big update brought in Jdaviz 4.0 concerns the introduction of [Solara](https://solara.dev/) to replace 
[Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for the rendering of the stand-alone application. 
I will not go into the details and technicalities of this swap here, 
but I will note that this results in better performance and cleaner code on the Jdaviz side. 

The release of 4.0 carries also bug fixes and performance improvements all over the app and especially updates to the 
Export Plugin, which now allows for the export of calculated quantities in the other plugins (e.g., the results of Aperture Photometry) 
in table format, defined regions of interests or subsets as well in table format, and generated products (e.g., analytic models 
fitted to observed spectra or moment maps fitted to cube data) in FITS format.

To give it a try, [installation instruction can be found in the documentation online](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) 
and as always the team can be contacted via [github issues](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/issues) or 
[help desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/jwst) calls. Whenther you have JWST data or other data, enjoy!
